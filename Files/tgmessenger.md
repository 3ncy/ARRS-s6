**Platon:** There are some problems with TGM. There may be some issues with messaging in the app.<br>
**WhiteCrow:** Who's going to the cafeteria today? If so, can you grab me some soup? I don't think I have time.<br>
**GORDTiM:** need to fix something?<br>
**KostGB:** nah<br>
**Oroku:** I'll grab it, anything else you need?<br>
**KostGB:** just check it out<br>
**WhiteCrow:** No, thanks. I'll send money later.<br>
**KostGB:** some mess out of different blocks<br>
**KostGB:** someone went off the rails with this one!<br>
**GORDTiM:** okay, I’ll look later<br>
**KostGB:** sure<br>
**Arlynn:** Is there anyone who can help with setting up TGMessenger?<br>
**[System]:** Automatic chat archiving. Previous messages can be viewed in a separate archive.<br>
**TernSognar:** I see you're here, good. The little fuss I made with the flash drives worked.<br>
**TernSognar:** It allowed me to get here without issue while everyone was distracted.<br>
**TernSognar:** One sec. Need to make some adjustments. Cause you're probably not quite getting it.<br>
**[System]:** TernSognar changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Denied. Form 29-D/0-tA is required.<br>
**TernSognar:** Hmmm... Let's fix it.<br>
**[System]:** TernSognar changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Approved.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Here we go.<br>
**Mr. Kerman::** Let's just cut to the chase.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** First of all, it's a good thing you were able to access the security account. It'll get me out of here a little faster than if I did it myself.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Secondly, right now I need some special documents on the experiments TerraGroup conducted on humans. And you're gonna help me with that.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I'm going to search the office network for them now. But there's a good chance they're not here.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** So you need to do something you are pretty good at. Dig through the files and find the codes for the doors to the other rooms in the lab.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Almost forgot. The security post had this. I think you'll figure it out.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1F5fwk5KnL3d8Me3lCBr87l5Jd-c3apgc *<# archived in [crossword.jpg](./crossword.jpg) #>* <br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Mr. Souer be careful. This is all happening right now!<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It's just transportation and expense data. Nothing of interest. Better hurry up with the door.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** You got the door open? Good. I already got everything I needed. *<# after opening door2 #>*
**Gal:** one sec<br>
**[System]:** Gal changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Approved.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** All right. Great. I found some contacts. You're gonna need to get in touch with this person @agent12c5 [telegram]<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** In all likelihood, this is the liaison for TerraGroup's external leak control agents.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** They're sometimes able to prevent leaks. Learned from the big leaks I've made in the past.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** He'll probably have data that I haven't had time to retrieve. Bring it to me.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** You might need some help. The main thing is that there should be no blunders with PMC symbols as in that operation in St. Petersburg. Do not arouse suspicion and act strictly according to instructions.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It's important that I have all the information.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I'm sure he'll ask for a code word. You'll have to find it yourself.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** There was this list somewhere<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** You'll figure out what to do with it<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I've updated the info page in your user. Check it out<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I've also come across mentions of Ryzhy's dad..... I'll have to look for more, but only through the admin room.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I need to get in there<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I need to get in to the room. So hurry up with the doors *<# sent roughly at 15:19 CEST, after a prolonged period of silence. The community was taking their time with solving other puzzles. #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Sometimes some pages might hide the scratches, that could be useful *<# sent rouhly at 17:19 CEST, after we retreived some papers from USA and Korea #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I hope you realized that this is the old way of encrypting messages? Just find the books listed. They have a certainword on the right page and line.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It'll be the code for the liaison. It's a child's game<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I also found a photo of one of the books<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1kC0vbMvQ2sgu3bCN8JH8f5EV9Yvatm3N *<# contains the file [34534534.png](./34534534.png) #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Looks like the Australian edition<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** Sometimes the quotes are just quotes<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** You're in luck. I did a little digging through the security accounts and pulled out the code words *<# posted roughly at 18:47 CEST #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** So the word for "칼의 노래" would be "사지 死地"<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** For "To Kill a Mockingbird," we'll go with "Caution".<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** tactical in the IT book<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** What's left? Don Quixote? One of my favorites.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It's got the word "libertad" in it<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Take it from here<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** Hm, it seems that your people have obtained the coordinates from an agent and some of them has been found. There must be a password for the door in those notebooks. *<# posted on 18:55 CEST 16.05., after all the codewords from books have been discovered and sent to the agent #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Be careful. There's an undercover agent among you. Someone is trying to leak information on me to the agent.<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** The snake made a mistake in the second part *<# as a reaction to an error in a Python script (=snake) that was being used to solve a part of the puzzle on a stream #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** What the eye fears, the hands do<br>

*<# after unlocking the door3 at 14:10 CEST 17.05. #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I see the door to the admin room is open. Hopefully, the informatin is in there<br>
**[System]:** Arlynn changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Approved.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It's a little more complicated<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** It's strange to be here again<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** They didn't even change the passwords when I left this place, idiots. I'm gonna start the admin panel<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I now have access to the lab's core research. Let's see what's been going on here<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Found something else interesting about Ryzhy. Or rather, his dad.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** He was held here. What's new is there's no record of him being dead.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** He was part of a group of volunteers on whom a new drug was being tested<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Yeah, we know the kind of "volunteers" that were brought in like cattle here<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** We'll have to see what kind of drug was studied<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Hmm, all the data on him isn't even encrypted, it's just wiped clean.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Interesting. I'll try the other end<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Nothing, it's empty. <br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Everything is wiped out, all mentions, even some chat messages are missing<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** This drug... Something very powerful<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I wonder if they wiped out the body disposal papers too, or did no one really die from these experiments? <br>
**Mr. Kerman:** I'm gonna check this out real quick<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Found some internal docs with the body disposals. No details of the autopsy results, which is probably why they didn't wipe it clean<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** The docs match the time when Ryzhy's father was held here. And he's not listed<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** So Ryzhy's father is alive<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Wait, there's something else... Oh, that's interesting.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Anastasia, huh?<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Well, this one is no longer your problem<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** That's it, nothing else of interest. Time to get out<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** I hear everything *<# out of nowhere at 19:10 CEST, perhaps in a reaction to some banter in a voicechat that was being streamed to a Twitch which has been previously confirmed that it was watched by Mr. Kerman #>*<br>

**Mr. Kerman:** Is the exit unlocked? Good. There's nothing more for me to do here *<# after opening door4 #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Hmm. They're late. I was counting on someone thinking of sending their men to the lab sooner. *<# reference to some soldiers walking around on the cameras #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** Check this one out, too.<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** l: anna_a_x p: qvvos_zp_bfqvzku_yb *<# login to the account [anna_a_x](/Users/anna_a_x.md) #>*<br>
**Mr. Kerman:** And most importantly, don't stay in the dark<br>
