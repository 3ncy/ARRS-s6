**Platon:** There are some problems with TGM. There may be some issues with messaging in the app.
**WhiteCrow:** Who's going to the cafeteria today? If so, can you grab me some soup? I don't think I have time.
**GORDTiM:** need to fix something?
**KostGB:** nah
**Oroku:** I'll grab it, anything else you need?
**KostGB:** just check it out
**WhiteCrow:** No, thanks. I'll send money later.
**KostGB:** some mess out of different blocks
**KostGB:** someone went off the rails with this one!
**GORDTiM:** okay, Iâ€™ll look later
**KostGB:** sure
**Arlynn:** Is there anyone who can help with setting up TGMessenger?
**[System]:** Automatic chat archiving. Previous messages can be viewed in a separate archive.
**TernSognar:** I see you're here, good. The little fuss I made with the flash drives worked.
**TernSognar:** It allowed me to get here without issue while everyone was distracted.
**TernSognar:** One sec. Need to make some adjustments. Cause you're probably not quite getting it.
**[System]:** TernSognar changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Denied. Form 29-D/0-tA is required.
**TernSognar:** Hmmm... Let's fix it.
**[System]:** TernSognar changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Approved.
**Mr. Kerman:** Here we go.
**Mr. Kerman::** Let's just cut to the chase.
**Mr. Kerman:** First of all, it's a good thing you were able to access the security account. It'll get me out of here a little faster than if I did it myself.
**Mr. Kerman:** Secondly, right now I need some special documents on the experiments TerraGroup conducted on humans. And you're gonna help me with that.
**Mr. Kerman:** I'm going to search the office network for them now. But there's a good chance they're not here.
**Mr. Kerman:** So you need to do something you are pretty good at. Dig through the files and find the codes for the doors to the other rooms in the lab.
**Mr. Kerman:** Almost forgot. The security post had this. I think you'll figure it out.
**Mr. Kerman:** https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1F5fwk5KnL3d8Me3lCBr87l5Jd-c3apgc
**Mr. Kerman:** Mr. Souer be careful. This is all happening right now!
**Gal:** one sec
**[System]:** Gal changes user name to Mr. Kerman. Approved.
**Mr. Kerman:** All right. Great. I found some contacts. You're gonna need to get in touch with this person @agent12c5 [telegram]
**Mr. Kerman:** In all likelihood, this is the liaison for TerraGroup's external leak control agents.
**Mr. Kerman:** They're sometimes able to prevent leaks. Learned from the big leaks I've made in the past.
**Mr. Kerman:** He'll probably have data that I haven't had time to retrieve. Bring it to me.
**Mr. Kerman:** You might need some help. The main thing is that there should be no blunders with PMC symbols as in that operation in St. Petersburg. Do not arouse suspicion and act strictly according to instructions.
**Mr. Kerman:** It's important that I have all the information.
**Mr. Kerman:** I'm sure he'll ask for a code word. You'll have to find it yourself.
**Mr. Kerman:** There was this list somewhere
**Mr. Kerman:** You'll figure out what to do with it
**Mr. Kerman:** I've updated the info page in your user. Check it out
**Mr. Kerman:** I've also come across mentions of Ryzhy's dad..... I'll have to look for more, but only through the admin room.
**Mr. Kerman:** I need to get in there
