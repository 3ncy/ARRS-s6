Hello, I've come here to say HI to all of the decoding enthusiasts. I speak on behalf of the team behind the event and I want to say thank you. Thank you for playing all those puzzles! And we sure will create more later on.<br>
We cherish those moments, when you wonder through those digits, finding clues, memes, references etc.<br>
This brings us joy, the fact that all pieces comes together after all.<br>
That story behind the puzzle is also entertaining and brings value to you.<br>

On my personal behalf, I want to say thank you. I've been making those puzzles since EFT's very announce. I volunteered for it. Now I'm letting it go, one event at time, to more proper people. Last several events are done mostly by other people and I'm really proud of them and their ideas.<br>
Best regards Mr. W.<br>

When you pad the front with one character to get `AUNDM0YzLTZXMzM2LVlUVDVVVVY3RDQtQ0 MyQkM5SjhCRDktWEVLNVUg`, you can see a part of the last game code from Viktor_S_O, with a complete game code for this user. `CC3F3-6W336-YTT5UUV7D4-CC2BC-J8BD9-XEK5U ` UV7D4-CC2BC-J8BD9-XEK5U was an EoD EU game code that has been redeemed.
