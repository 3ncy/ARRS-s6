Hello, employee.

Great news, you've been put in charge of guarding and monitoring the fourth floor of the laboratory. 

The basic principles of working with the new programs are described below.

The Security Manager process is a floor control program.
- When you open the program you will see a map of the selected floor. Other floors are not available to you.
- Switching between floors for your access level is not available.
- Switching between different rooms on the floor is available by command change_room [room ID]
-- Some rooms require a password. It will be issued as needed.
- The doors are opened by command open_door [room ID]
-- The room ID is displayed on the command chart.
-- Doors require a door password to open.
- The cameras are viewed by command сam [camera ID]
-- Important: Due to security errors, the camera opens in a separate window and is accessible to an external user. Do not share links to an external network. Otherwise, you will be penalized.
-- Switching cameras in the same room is currently unavailable.

Recommendation
You can open Security Manager on a second screen for more effective monitoring. Each observed case of non-functional behavior must be reported.


TGMessanger process introduces modified messenger
- For easy monitoring of staff, it collects all staff correspondence from all chat rooms on the floor.
- The ability to write messages is temporarily blocked so that employees do not realize that we are reading their correspondence.
- Important: User's name is not the login for the terminal

[14:15] Officer23: Hey
[14:15] Officer11: Hello
[14:15] Officer23: You heard the news? I've been transferred to another floor and I'm now filling in for the security guard.
[14:15] Officer11: Wow, what floor?
[14:15] Officer23: 4
[14:16] Officer11: So how is it?
[14:16] Officer23: Ohoho... Now I can read all kinds of messages. You should see what they write. I have to report anything bad or suspicious.
[14:16] Officer11: Sick. Make sure you save it to have a laugh after work.
[14:16] Officer23: Will do just that
[14:16] Officer23: You know what the dumbest part is?
[14:17] Officer11: ?
[14:18] Officer23: In security, the drawn floor plan is slightly different from what is on the floor. I even asked why. And what did they say? Some IT guy drew it, but he doesn't have access to the floor. And he did it purely by eye and the stories of employees from this floor. 
[14:18] Officer11: lol
[14:18] Officer23: Yeah
[14:21] Officer23: Anyway, I'm gonna check around the floor

[17:21] Officer23: Turns out it's a lot of fun to scare employees with doors
[17:21] Officer11: lol how
[17:22] Officer23: Well, imagine a four-eyes comes to the door, locks it behind him with a code, and you open it back up haha
[17:22] Officer11: Fucking awesome, I want to try it.
[17:22] Officer23: You're replacing me here next week, aren't you?
[17:22] Officer11: Yeah, you're going on vacation, right?
[17:23] Officer23: Yup. I was just gonna go to the health resort for a vacation. And here's the thing. They won't give you the passwords to the door since you're just the replacement.  
[17:23] Officer11: Yeah, you signed a lot of paperwork for that, didn't you?
[17:23] Officer23: That's not the point. I'll give you a hint to the code to the first door so we don't get burned instantly. 
[17:23] Officer11: Deal
[18:04] Officer23: See the crossword puzzle on my desk.
