recognized_voice_01: Tolya no time to tiktoks, put your phone down
recognized_voice_02: It’s not tiktoks Georgie
recognized_voice_01: We got some crazy stuff going on around the office, and you're flashing your phone
recognized_voice_02: That’s why I turned it on. You get it? 
recognized_voice_01: No
recognized_voice_03: Really, Tolya, we have more important issues to deal with.
recognized_voice_02: Come on, man, the phone stays on. You and me, we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. And everybody's starting to freak out. I don't know what the hell's gonna happen down there. This way we'll have some information about us.
recognized_voice_01: You want to keep the memory? Uh-huh.
recognized_voice_03: Well, I don't know how much help that's gonna be. Identify the bodies, I guess.
recognized_voice_02: Maybe ID the bodies, yes. Might be a useful record for blackmailing important people.
recognized_voice_01: Maybe ID the bodies, yes. Might be a useful record for blackmailing important people.
recognized_voice_02: You do you, but I’ll record this.
recognized_voice_03: Sure you will, but please help us here, we need you at your PC.

recognized_voice_02: Our passes don't work for some doors.
recognized_voice_03: Maybe someone's been messing with the DBs again. 
recognized_voice_02: The DBs are written fine, there shouldn't be anything wrong with it.
recognized_voice_03: It's not about writing BDs, but about using them. There are idiots around. Like that new guy Eugene who made such a mess of this perfect system, it's awful.
recognized_voice_02: It's not about the databases. Look for yourself. There's a lot of these USECs all over the place. And they're taking people somewhere.
recognized_voice_04: Please, move this way. No questions! 
unrecognized_voice: [obscured speech sounds]
recognized_voice_05: No, we can’t answer any questions, please, move along.
recognized_voice_02: [whispering] Look, they're taking the scientists somewhere.
recognized_voice_01: [whispering] What are they doing, having some kind of Nobel convention?  
recognized_voice_03: [whispering] Then why are all the guards armed? Handing out money?
recognized_voice_02: It looks like... Did you get any mail recently? Like a bulletin or an alert or something?
recognized_voice_01: Nope.
recognized_voice_03: No, it’s as usual.
recognized_voice_02: This shit is not good. 
recognized_voice_01: Come on, what shit?
recognized_voice_02: I don't know. But we're not part of those plans, as you can see.
recognized_voice_03: Hey, guys. They took away access to the doors, but what about the servers?
(pause with background footsteps and some chatter.)
recognized_voice_02: That's the idea. You guys are welcome, but I wouldn't pass up a chance like that. I don't know what the hell's going on. But it's like we're out.
recognized_voice_05: Keep moving, please, keep moving.
[obscured speech sounds]
[sounds of footsteps]
recognized_voice_03: You go to our stations, and I'll try to get to the managers' computers. Recently one of them had to update the system, I still remember the password. 
recognized_voice_01: You don't think he had time to change?
recognized_voice_03: These guys are statistically the most vulnerable to cyberattacks. So I don't think so.
recognized_voice_02: Hurry up, then. If we're not at your place in ten minutes, we have access

recognized_voice_03: Come on guys move your asses!
[sounds of footsteps]
[door closed]
recognized_voice_03: According to the maps this passage leads to communications.
recognized_voice_02: Communications? I thought we were getting out of here, not getting in deeper!
recognized_voice_03: Quiet, Tolya, we don't want them to hear us.
[sounds of footsteps]
recognized_voice_01: So why are we going in deeper?
recognized_voice_03: There's an exit there.
recognized_voice_01: What don't you like about the other exits?
recognized_voice_03: You know, like the fact that they're official exits. That there's definitely USECs in there. You can't get out from there.
recognized_voice_02: What, no overhead passageway at all? A vent or something?
recognized_voice_03: Everything goes into one tunnel, one communication node on the other side. We can even make our way straight to the TerraGroup offices.
recognized_voice_01: Yeah, that sucks. What's down there?
recognized_voice_03: Well, there's a drainage system. I mean, they've done their due diligence here. It'll drain the water.
recognized_voice_01: Just water? It's a sewer.
recognized_voice_02: Yeah, through the vent would be like a movie, only from underground.
[gunshot sounds]
recognized_voice_02: Fuck…
recognized_voice_01: There's your answer to why everyone was in such a hurry.
[sounds of footsteps]
recognized_voice_03: Take a left here, let’s move quick.
