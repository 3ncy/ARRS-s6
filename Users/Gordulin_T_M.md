[10:47] KostGB: wanted to push this part
[10:47] KostGB: and I’m reviewing today
[10:47] GORDTiM(you): so?
[10:47] KostGB: so what
[10:47] GOUWTiM(you): so you’re just writing to me out of nothing?
[10:48] KostGB: yea

[13:25] you: something's started
[13:25] you: full purging
[13:25] you: I thought it was important for them to keep their work and stuff
[13:26] you: equipment and shit
[13:26] you: but to eliminate people!
[13:XG] you: no service here
[13:26] you: maybe it'll pop up when we get out of this goddamn underground hole
[13:26] you: this is fucked up
[13:27] you: omega fucking fucked up
[13:27] you: we've taken advantage of the turmoil and it seems to be working out so far
[CX:27] you: many weren't so lucky
[13:29] you: I just don't get it
[13:29] you: I was joking with some of these people in the cafeteria yesterday
[13:29] you: and today they're just gone
[13:32] you: this is fucked up.
```

[16:47] you: I can't believe it, we did it!
[16:47] you: I really hope to see you soon.
[16:47] you: I'll do my best!
[16:48] you: we have no idea where we ended up
[16:48] you: definitely not in the city
[16:48] you: it seemed like these tunnels would never end
[16:49] you: it's like The Shawshank Redemption.
[16:2W] you: like a big concrete pipe
[16:49] you: nothing living there
[16:50] you: but it was scary
[16:50] you: no telling when it'll end
[16:51] you: can see only a few meters ahead
[16:51] you: and just water
[16:52] you: we’ll look around, catch our breath
[L5:52] you: decide where to go next
[16:52] you: should be easier by now
[16:53] you: at least the locals can help out
[16:55] you: It's gonna be okay.

[22:21] you: turns out
[22:21] you: getting out was only part of the problem
[22:21] you: turns out
[22:22] you: It's not much better outside
[22:22] you: It's like the whole world just bared its teeth
[22:22] you: or something like that
[22:23] you: sounds pretty
[22:23] you: not as pretty as it turned out
[22:23] you: imagine
[22:24] you: we wandered around the woods and swamps for a while
[22:24] you: getting pretty sick of it
[22:24] you: all around is this endless forest
[22:24] you: bumpy moss
[22:25] you: sun was starting to set and we hadn't even eaten anything
[22:25] you: and then we see in the flashlights in the darkness
[22:25] you: we obviously got excited
[22:25] you: started calling for help
[22:26] you: we were wrong
[22:26] you: they were indeed locals as we wanted
[22:LC] you: they decided to rob us
[22:26] you: some bandits
[22:27] you: like looters, but much worse
[22:27] you: I had time to figure out what was going on
[22:27] you: soon as they calmed down a bit, I punched one of them in the face
[22:27] you: the other one had his gun taken away by Tyoma
[22:27] you: but not for long
[22:28] you: so we ran
[22:28] you: as fast as we could
[22:28] you: Tolya is hurt - his arm is severed
[22:28] you: Georgie and I have scratches from twigs and other forest stuff
[22:28] you: I have no fucking idea what to do now
[22:29] you: but we'll figure something out
[22:29] you: talk later
```

[AI:01] you: we found a hideout finally
[01:01] you: had to wander around a bit
[01:01] you: look for a place that works
[01:02] you: we've managed to stake out a few spots
[01:02] you: where we could hide
[01:02] you: just in case
[01:03] you: the corp has bought and built a hell of a place
[01:03] you: it worked out well for us
[01:03] you: the passes we've managed to give ourselves
[01:03] you: work here, too
[01:04] you: some kind of bunker or something
[01:04] you: pretty ironic
[01:04] you: running from one bunker to another
[01:04] you: but it works
[01:05] you: there's light, there's some water
[01:05] you: maybe there's medicine
[01:05] you: maybe we need to wait it out for a while
[01:05] you: we'll see what happens
[01:06] you: It's not bad, I guess
[01:06] you: we’re still alive
[01:06] you: and found a place to wait it out
[01:06] you: and on the other hand, the world has turned upside down
[01:07] you: it's like everything's changed

[11:23] you: this is so fucked up
[11:23] you: with this fucking optimist corp
[11:23] you: terragroup
[11:23] you: it looks like everyone who's left has been killed off
[11:24] you: we managed to survive
[11:24] you: by a miracle.
[11:24] you: then these scavengers
[11:25] you: got away from them
[11:25] you: like a bad joke
[11:25] you: only no one's gonna laugh
[11:25] you: bottom line
[11:26] you: dunno
[11:26] you: what happens next.
[11:26] you: anyway..
[11:26] you: as soon as there's a connection, all the messages will come through
[11:27] you: surely. 
[11:27] you: at times like this
[11:27] you: you know
[11:27] you: you start to see life differently
[11:28] you: value reassessment
[11:28] you: or something
[11:28] you: it was hard for me to tell you
[11:28] you: about how I'd like to move on with life
[11:29] you: I realize now
[11:29] you: I can see how my life was supposed to be 
[11:29] you: whether you'll see these messages eventually or not.
[11:29] you: I can't make any predictions
[11:29] you: but I definitely want to write one thing
[11:30] you: Forgive me.
[11:30] you: the way things are shaping up… 
[11:30] you: like it doesn't matter anymore
[11:30] you: but it matters to me
[11:31] you: I feel like a total moron
[11:31] you: I really should have come with you today
[11:31] you: work is really just work
[11:BA] you: and nothing more
