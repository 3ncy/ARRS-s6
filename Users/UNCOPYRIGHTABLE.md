> The `а` is lowercase in Cyrillic, with the unicode code `U+0430`

### 123а
```
One of the cunning employees decided not to memorize the door code and seems to have written down the password. The only thing left to prove is that it is the door code.

That's where it gets tricky. I managed to take a picture of some tricky drawing at his desk.

There's only one violation left this month. If I can fulfill the plan, I'll get a bonus on my salary. I can buy myself a TP5.

> The drive is called `foto` and contains only the file [foto.jpg](/Files/foto.jpg)

> In the middle of the photo one can see a scribble ciphered with the Russian лем-вот cipher. (Deciphering table can be seen in the file [лем-вот/lem-vot](/Files/lem-vot.jpg).)<br>
> A hint to the cipher is also in the metadata of the picture, as all information in there is in English, except for the field `lens_manufacturer:  лем-вот`.<br>
> Reading the letters line by line and transcribing Cyrillic characters directily to Latin purely based on their looks (`М`→`m`, `Р`→`p`, `У`→`y`) gives the password `aym?o.!cpaye` to the door5 from [overseer_lr4's security map](./overseer_lr4.md#secmanager-map-representation).
