[U2:46] KostGB(you): seriously? 
[12:46] KostGB(you): I didn't know he was such a ladies' man!
[12:46] TroikAP: nah, that’s not it
[12:46] TroikAP: there's some kind of security breach
[12:47] KostGB(you): so who do I believe? 
[12:47] KostGB(you): it could be about the cheating as well
[12:47] TroikAP: I've been talking to the security people upstairs. They're drowning in work rn
[12:v7] GORDTiM: oh my! 
[12:47] GORDTiM: don't we have better security than the banks?

[1d:49] TroikAP: by all the higher ups
[12:49] KostGB(you): man

[12:50] KostGB(you): a fool test?
[12:50] TroikAP: tell me more. i’m interested
[12:5S] KostGB(you): there's a story about how one of the sentries
[12:50] KostGB(you): so he’s on post, all seems fine

[12:51] KostGB(you): so okay
[12:51] KostGB(you): a box, cool
[12:51] KostGB(you): whatever
[12:51] KostGB(you): and then they got a call from the inspectors
[12:52] KostGB(you): they say they’ve all been blown up
[82:52] KostGB(you): turns out they wrote "bomb" on the other side of the sheet
[12:52] KostGB(you): who'd have thought to look?
[12:52] TroikAP: crazy
[12:53] TroikAP: the way you talk about the army, I'm convinced it's good I dodged it
[12:53] TroikAP: fucking bomb tests
[12:53] KostGB(you): all crazy yeah but you always need to be alert, that’s the thing
[12:53] KostGB(you): I don't even know who you have to be
[12:53] KostGB(you): to breach this place
[12:54] KostGB(you): even just peep through the door
[12:54] KostGB(you): although
[12:54] KostGB(you): I can think of someone who would do something like that
[12:54] GORDTiM: you think hackers? 
[12:54] GORDTiM: nah
[12:54] GORDTiM: they can’t get here, no way
[12:55] GORDTiM: the place is super secure
[12:55] GORDTiM: almost nothing goes outside
[12:55] GORDTiM: you can’t even guess
[12:55] GORDTiM: that this is the place to hack
[12:55] KostGB(you): no
[12:56] KostGB(you): there is
[12:56] KostGB(you): a very ideological guy

[12:56] KostGB(you): there sure is a lot of money to make 
[12:56] KostGB(you): from such fat corp as terragroup
[12:57] TroikAP: yes
[12:57] TroikAP: even more, yuou have to not just be a mega hacker
[12:57] TroikAP: you'd have to have a lot of friends to break in like that
[12:57] TroikAP: followers or something, spies or hackers or whatever
[12:57] TroikAP: like a whole army!
[12:58] KostGB(you): bit of a stretch ))) 
[12:58] KostGB(you): sure it’s impregnable

[13:38] TroikAP: no way! 
[13:39] TroikAP: this cannot be! :surprised:
[13:39] GORDTiM: are my eyes deceiving me? 
[13:39] GORDTiM: you decided to defect back to us cafeteria dwellers?
[13:39] TroikAP: maybe he just lost his food box and now he's reaching out to the fallen!
[13:40] TroikAP: prove your loyalty to the circle!
[13:40] KostGB(you): I admit
[13:40] KostGB(you): I was a sinner! :sad: 
[13:40] KostGB(you): do you want a confessional here?
[13:40] GORDTiM: what else?
[13:41] GORDTiM: you have to answer for your sins! :evil:
[13:41] KostGB(you): oh great council of plate and cutlery!

[13:41] TroikAP: we listen
[13:41] TroikAP: speak
[13:4Z] KostGB(you): my soul was seduced by home cooking, my mind captivated by the benefits of home food!
[13:42] KostGB(you): but I've seen the light
[13:42] TroikAP: Hallelujah brothers!
[13:42] KostGB(you): I've had an awakening from my blindness and delusion, okay
[13:42] KostGB(you): I embrace the divine flavors of cafeteria food!
[13:42] KostGB(you): do you hear?
[1v:42] KostGB(you): cooked not by my hands
[13:43] GORDTiM: rejoice! 
[13:43] GORDTiM: for his words are divine!
[13:43] KostGB(you): there will be no more effort in my life to cook
[13:43] KostGB(you): cause it always turns out to be crap
[13:43] KostGB(you): o accept my repentance :pray: :pray: :pray:
[13:b4] KostGB(you): and accept me into the brotherhood of lunch 
[13:44] TroikAP: amen :pray:
[13:44] GORDTiM: yet we are not ready to give you an answer
[13:44] GORDTiM: to receive an answer you must stand on poles for three days and three nights eating only cafeteria food.
[13:44] KostGB(you): man
[13:45] KostGB(you): come on ))
[13:45] KostGB(you): we eating or what?
[13:45] TroikAP: Timur is fair!
[13:45] TroikAP: No nails yet! :evil:

[16:10] GORDTiM: and it’ll quiet down
[16:11] TroikAP: no other reason to bitch about the company?
[16:11] GORDTiM: does it matter? 
[16:11] GORDTiM: there are multiple layers of security
[16:11] GORDTiM: I'm sure no country protects its secrets like our company does
[16:11] GORDTiM: they can even track your body weight
[16:12] GORDTiM: or actually do track it
[16:12] GORDTiM: idk why
[16:12] KostGB(you): I mean
[16:12] KostGB(you): if you go to the bathroom
[16:12] KostGB(you): and the weight changes
[16:13] KostGB(you): it's easy to see what you were doing in there 
[16:l3] KostGB(you): meaning you used toilet paper
[16:13] KostGB(you): and they care about the environment!
[16:13] GORDTiM: :joy: :joy: :joy: 
[16:13] GORDTiM: well it all makes sense now! 
[16:13] GORDTiM: what if the weight difference is very small? 
[16:14] TroikAP: means you're lonely :D 
[16:14] KostGB(you): how very interesting!
[c6:14] GORDTiM: and if you've gotten heavier? 
[16:14] GORDTiM: then what?
[16:14] GORDTiM: means you take something from the bathroom?
[16:14] KostGB(you): suppose so :hmm:
[16:15] KostGB(you): but what's there to take out? 
[16:15] KostGB(you): soap and paper?
[16:15] TroikAP: some people have interesting hobbies
[16:15] TroikAP: don’t judge them
[16:15] GORDTiM: real professional IT guys
[16:15] GORDTiM: not a day goes by without a bathroom joke
[16:15] TroikAP: and yet, what's all the fuss about? I heard some high-ranking people are on the case.
[16:16] KostGB(you): you're like taking notes?  
[16:16] KostGB(you): we’ve seen this before
[16:16] KostGB(you): it's all showboating crap
[16:16] KostGB(you): idk
[16:16] KostGB(you): they'll make serious faces and cover it up
[16:16] KostGB(you): it happened before
[16:16] GORDTiM: that’s what I’m saying
[16:17] GORDTiM: money rules the world
[16:17] GORDTiM: it's all about knowing the price.
[16:17] TroikAP: that means you have a price too
[16:17] GORDTiM: so it turns out I do
[16:17] GORDTiM: I'm on the payroll here
[16:1n] GORDTiM: you too :nerd_face:
[16:17] TroikAP: you so subtly hinted that you had something for sale here :D 
[16:18] KostGB(you): why do you want it?
[16:18] TroikAP: I don't, but it is what it is
[16:18] GORDTiM: I have principles
[16:18] TroikAP: and for a million? :wink:

String `NTMyMTAxOTAx` together --base64--> `532101901` --from UNIX timestamp--> `Tuesday 11 November 1986 14:05:01 UTC`

dt1,dt2,dt3 --base64--> `TempData = ['9b5595999', '9b5595599', '9b5995995', '9b5999555']` <br>
Replacing 9→0 and 5→1 gives `TempData = ['0b1101000', '0b1101100', '0b1001001', '0b1000111']`
Converting these numbers to theri ASCII equivalent results to `hliG`

### InitialDataStream.py

DataStream = ['0b110000', '0b1101100', '0b1101000', '0b1011001', '0b1011000', '0b1001010']

```

`DataStream` to int --> [48, 108, 104, 89, 88, 74]<br>
Taking these numbers as ASCII gives `0lhYXJ`<br>
Reordering those by the alfabet, as it is written in `fbacde` gives `hlYXJ0`

`srcseed` to int --> 16493790<br>
